🧮 Faulty Calculator
The Faulty Calculator is a fun JavaScript-based project that performs incorrect calculations intentionally based on predefined conditions. It looks like a normal calculator but sometimes gives wrong answers to test logic handling and randomness in programming.

*Features
Performs basic arithmetic operations:
.Addition
.Subtraction
.Multiplication
.Division

Produces wrong results for specific conditions to simulate a faulty system
Simple and user-friendly UI
Built using pure JavaScript
JavaScript – Logic & functionality

*How It Works
The calculator normally performs correct calculations.
For some predefined operations, it returns incorrect results on purpose.
This is useful for understanding:
Conditional statements
Random number logic
Error simulation in programs
